In most of our tests normalizing ended up being better than scaling, but one of the scaling tests turned out the be the best overall. \n","\n","We selected (k=1,p=2) with normalized data to test on the whole dataset and obtained an accuracy of 36%. We note that however this may be specific to our choice of a random seed, and that our accuracy may change a lot if we choose another seed. Due to time constraints we were unable to test the case (k=7,p=1) scaled on the whole dataset.\n","\n","With its limitations in mind, we see that the method is more accurate with more training data. For future experiments we will vary the seed to investigate further.\n","\n","Lastly, if more computational resources are available we will test more cases for p. When we ran the predictor with p = 3, it took 45 seconds with a size 1000 dataset to process. With p = 1,2 or np.inf, it took about 3 seconds on average. We also note that while np.inf can be computed quickly, it yields the least accurate results. This can be explained easily: no matter how close two pictures look, if one pixel is off, then the images will be considered very different."]}]}
